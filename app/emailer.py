        Hi,

        {adder_name} added you as a watcher on the task "{todo_title}".

        What is {APP_NAME}? It's a shared to-do app that organizes tasks around
        the different parts of your life. Being a watcher means you'll get a short
        email whenever this task changes (a new status, a comment, or a file),
        so you stay in the loop without anyone having to chase you. You can also
        open the task to read its full history and add comments yourself, no
        account or password required:

        {task_link}

        Don't want to be kept in the loop? You can opt out of all updates for
        this task at any time, no sign-in needed:
